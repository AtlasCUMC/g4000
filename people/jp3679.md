##Academic/Professional Interests
I am a pediatric hematology, oncology, and bone marrow transplant clinical fellow at the Columbia University Medical Center New York Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital. I am interested in applying computational biology and bioinformatics tools to evaluating omics data to further understanding of tumorgenesis and targeted therapies in pediatric oncology. I hope to lead a pediatric precision oncology program one day.

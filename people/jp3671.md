## Academic Interests
I'm interested in the intersection between informatics and cooking!

### Prediction of Flavor/Tastes of Food from Recipes 
Deep learning based prediction of the flavor, and potentially Yelp-rating only from the recipes. We will utilize bayesian deep learning to minimize aleatoric/heteroscedastic uncertainty. The network will be a 2-million layer network. 
(Warning: .... please do not take this seriously!)

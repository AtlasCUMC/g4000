## Current Projects

### All of Us Research Program 

I am a technical lead at Columbia University for the All of Us Research Program, a historic effort to gather data over many years from one million or more people living in the United States, with the ultimate goal of accelerating research and improving health ([source](https://allofus.nih.gov/about)). Columbia University Medical Center is one of several [health care provider organizations](https://allofus.nih.gov/about/program-components/health-care-provider-organizations) where participants can enroll in the research study. We are also helping to build the [Data and Research Center](https://allofus.nih.gov/about/program-components/data-research-center), which will acquire, organize, and provide secure access to what will be one of the worldâ€™s largest and most diverse datasets for precision medicine research. 

### New York City Clinical Data Research Network
I am a technical lead at Columbia University for The New York City Clinical Data Research Network (NYC-CDRN), a program funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) and which brings together 22 organizations including seven independent health systems to enable patient-centered clinical research, support a national network, and facilitate learning healthcare systems (see [article](https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/21/4/587/2909249/Changing-the-research-landscape-the-New-York-City)).

### Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics
I am a technical lead for the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (or OHDSI, pronounced "Odyssey") program, a multi-stakeholder, interdisciplinary collaborative to bring out the value of health data through large-scale analytics. OHDSI has established an international network of researchers and observational health databases with a central coordinating center housed at Columbia University (see [ohdsi.org](https://www.ohdsi.org/)).
